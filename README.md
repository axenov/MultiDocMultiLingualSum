# Multi-Document Multi-Lingual Summarization

Code to reproduce data, models and results of the paper **Multi-Language Multi-Document Summarization**.

## Multi-Wiki-News

### Reproduce the dataset

All the code to create Multi-Wiki-News and reproduce stats and explaination are in the [``dataset``](/dataset) folder.

### Load the dataset

Raw data of each version of the dataset are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1805OtY_T0lVL3xCSGPvBdQpAkvIl6eO4?usp=sharing).

You can also load the dataset with the [HuggingFace nlp library](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp) using ``en_wiki_multi_news.py`` for the English version, ``de_wiki_multi_news.py`` for the German version or ``fr_wiki_multi_news.py`` for the French one.

For load the Multi-en-Wiki-News, run:

```python
from nlp import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('en_wiki_multi_news.py', cache_dir='dataset/.en-wiki-multi-news-cache')

train_dataset = dataset['train']
validation_dataset = dataset['validation']
test_dataset = dataset['test']
```

## Models

Training models are available as HugginFace models [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=airKlizz).

Implementation code and training scripts are in the [``train``](/train) folder.

For example, you can use BART fine-tuned on Multi-en-Wiki-News as follow:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelWithLMHead

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-large")

# Load model
model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained("airKlizz/bart-large-multi-en-wiki-news")

# Prepare inputs
inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(TEXT_TO_SUMMARIZE, max_length=1024, return_tensors="pt")

# Summarize
outputs = model.generate(
  input_ids=inputs['input_ids'], 
  attention_mask=inputs['attention_mask'], 
  max_length=400, 
  min_length=150, 
  length_penalty=2.0, 
  num_beams=4, 
  early_stopping=True
)

# Decode
summary = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)
print(summary)
```

## Results

All extractive and abstractive models implementations and evaluation scripts are in the [``evaluate``](/evaluate) folder.

We create an summarization evaluation environement easy to use for all models and all datasets. You can find more details in the [``evaluate``](/evaluate) folder.
